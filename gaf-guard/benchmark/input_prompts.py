By identifying patterns and similarities, the AI can suggest potential new therapeutic indications for existing drugs, based on the chemical structure and pharmacological properties of the APIs. This process can help streamline the drug development pipeline, as it would reduce the need for time-consuming and expensive clinical trials for new indications. For instance, a drug like Atorvastatin, which is currently used to lower cholesterol, could be repurposed for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disease, based on the AI's analysis of similar drugs and their clinical data. This would not only save resources but also provide new treatment options for patients suffering from this debilitating condition. \n        Question: What domain does your use request fall under?
