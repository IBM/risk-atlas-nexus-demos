            "2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: RL is used in two out of three examples, where it is employed to optimize the performance of generative models or to generate code snippets/dialog flows based on classified instructions.\n",
            "3. **Text Generation**: Text generation techniques are used in multiple examples, such as generating reports, recommendations, insights from historical data, and personalized responses/recommendations for customers.\n",
            "4. **Computer Vision**: Computer vision is only mentioned in one example, where it is used for image classification, image segmentation, text-to-image, and object detection (although not explicitly stated to be utilized).\n",
            "5. **Multi-Modal**: Some examples mention multi-modal techniques, such as document question-answering, visual question answering, or video-and-text-to-text interactions, but these are not the primary techniques used in the system.\n",
            "6. **Tabular**: Tabular classification and regression are only mentioned in one example, where they are used for optimizing waste management processes.\n",
            "\n",
            "To answer questions about what techniques are utilized in a system, one should look for the presence of NLP, RL, text generation, computer vision (when explicitly mentioned), and tabular techniques. The exact combination and sub-techniques can provide insights into the specific application or use case of the system.\n",
